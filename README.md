# Hi there, I'm Kavita! üëã

## üöÄ About Me

I'm an **enthusiastic app builder** who loves creating meaningful digital experiences! I believe in keeping the **psychology of the user** at the heart of every application I develop.

Currently working on **GoldClub** at work and building **everydaystylo** as a side project üí´

## üî• What I'm Working On

- üíé **GoldClub**: At work, I'm building GoldClub - the world's first B2B Jewellery SUPERAPP. Our team is really excited about empowering unorganised jewelry retailers to go digital seamlessly. It's a cutting-edge eCommerce platform with 50,000+ jewelry designs, dynamic pricing for gold rates, and custom themes. We launched in 2023 and it's been an incredible journey helping retailers unlock growth in the digital space.
