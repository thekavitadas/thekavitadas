# Hi there, I'm Kavita! 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm an **enthusiastic app builder** who loves creating meaningful digital experiences! I believe in keeping the **psychology of the user** at the heart of every application I develop.

Currently working on **GoldClub** and building **everydaystylo** as a side project 💫

## 🔥 What I'm Working On

- 💎 **GoldClub**: <img src="https://goldclub.co/img/logo.png" alt="GoldClub Logo" width="25" height="25" style="vertical-align: middle;"> Building GoldClub - a cutting-edge B2B Jewelry SUPERAPP. Our team is really excited about empowering unorganised jewelry retailers to go digital seamlessly. It's an innovative eCommerce platform with 50,000+ jewelry designs, dynamic pricing for gold rates, and custom themes. It's been an incredible journey helping retailers unlock growth in the digital space. I manage GoldClub tech and all engineers.
